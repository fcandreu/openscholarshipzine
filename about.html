  <title>Open Scholarship Zine - Our Story</title>
  <body>
<h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      During <a href="https://www.opencon2018.org">OpenCon 2018</a> a group of motivated advocates, researchers, librarians, and scholars gathered to discuss the ways we could decolonize scholarship. During this discussion everyone was allowed space to share their perspectives and motivations for joining this Un-Conference session. </p>

<p>While we were in the session our facilitators broke us into groups based on interests expressed in our introductions. One member of the group mentioned Naomi Wolff’s book titled, The End of America, and the context of how she describes closing an open society. Applying this to the creation of knowledge and opening academic scholarship the group ruminated on the idea and she read off the 10 steps to close an open society (see addendum). </p>

<p>From there another group member introduced us all to a strategy called “Triz”, which stands for “Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch" in Russian and translates into English as ‘Theory of Inventive Problem Solving.’</p>

<p>Created by Genrich Altshuller and colleagues in 1946, the method of Triz is to plan and organize for solutions based on worst case scenario. Utilizing Wolff’s 10 Steps we were able to develop our worst case scenario for Open Scholarship based on case studies from around the globe. With our 10 Steps to Closing Open Scholarship we were able to identify case studies from Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, the Pacific and beyond. </p>

<p>Once you review our Zine you will learn more about how these 10 Steps are already enacted throughout the world. Meaning, Open Scholarship is already becoming and has been a restricted and in some cases criminalized process. </p>

<p>Our website allows readers to go a step further and utilize an interactive timeline of the cases selected and get tools for advocacy.
