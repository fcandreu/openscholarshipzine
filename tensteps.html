<h1> The 10 Steps</h1>
<p>
Wolf outlines ten steps that "closing societies" — such as Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Stalin's Russia — have historically followed. These steps, Wolf claims, are being observed in America now.
  The steps are:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy.</li>
<li>Create secret prisons where torture takes place.</li>
<li>Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens.</li>
<li>Set up an internal surveillance system.</li>
<li>Harass citizens' groups.</li>
<li>Engage in arbitrary detention and release.</li>
<li>Target key individuals.</li>
<li>Control the press.</li>
<li>Cast criticism as espionage and dissent as treason.</li>
  <li>Subvert the rule of law.[3]</li>
</ol>
